import "errors"

// Domain-level sentinel errors for mneme. These are returned by service and store
// layers to communicate precise failure reasons to callers without leaking
// implementation details. Callers should compare with errors.Is().

// ErrNotFound is returned when a requested memory does not exist in the store.
// Distinct from a database error — it means the query succeeded but matched nothing.
var ErrNotFound = errors.New("memory not found")

// ErrInvalidType is returned when a MemoryType value is not one of the recognised
// constants. Used to reject unknown types before they reach the database.
var ErrInvalidType = errors.New("invalid memory type")

// ErrInvalidScope is returned when a Scope value is not one of the recognised
// constants. Used to reject unknown scopes before they reach the database.
var ErrInvalidScope = errors.New("invalid scope")

// ErrTitleRequired is returned when a SaveRequest arrives with an empty Title.
// The title is the primary searchable field; a memory without one is not useful.
var ErrTitleRequired = errors.New("title is required")

// ErrContentRequired is returned when a SaveRequest arrives with empty Content.
// Content is the body of knowledge; a memory without content has no value.
var ErrContentRequired = errors.New("content is required")

// ErrSummaryRequired is returned when a SessionEndRequest arrives with an empty
// Summary. Without a summary the session_summary Memory cannot be created.
var ErrSummaryRequired = errors.New("session summary is required")

// ErrQueryRequired is returned when a SearchRequest arrives with an empty Query.
// An empty query would return unfiltered results, which is almost never correct
// from an agent — callers that want a full list should use a dedicated list API.
var ErrQueryRequired = errors.New("search query is required")
