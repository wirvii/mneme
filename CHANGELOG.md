## [Unreleased]

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Permission enforcement by capability** (SPEC-034): role boundaries are now
  enforced at the capability level for all five subagents, not only the
  orchestrator.
  - `architect.md` and `qa-tester.md`: replaced `permissionMode: bypassPermissions`
    with an explicit read-only `tools:` allowlist (`Read, Grep, Glob,
    NotebookRead, BashOutput, mcp__mneme__*`). These agents can no longer
    invoke `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`, `Bash`, or `NotebookEdit`.
  - `backend.md`, `frontend.md`, `bug-hunter.md`: added explicit
    `tools: Read, Grep, Glob, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, BashOutput, Edit,
    Write, MultiEdit, Bash, mcp__mneme__*`. Retained
    `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` for autonomous runs with a comment
    documenting the intent.
- **Blocked-edit discovery logging** in `enforce_delegation.sh`: the bash
  `PreToolUse` hook now calls `mneme save --type discovery` on every
  orchestrator block, storing a structured markdown record with what/why/
  learned sections. The call is guarded by `command -v mneme` and uses
  `|| true` so failures never affect the exit-2 guarantee. Blocked attempts
  are queryable via `mneme search "Blocked edit"`.
- `docs/enforcement-model.md`: full reference for the two-layer enforcement
  model (capability allowlist + bash hook), including the allowlist table,
  automated checks, how to add a new subagent, and a debugging guide.
- `CLAUDE.md` (repo root): new "Enforcement Model" subsection under
  Architecture summarising the two layers and linking to
  `docs/enforcement-model.md`.

### Changed

- `internal/install/install_test.go`: three new marker-based tests
  (`TestDelegationHookContent_LogsBlockedAttempts`,
  `TestAgentAssets_ReadOnlyAllowlists`,
  `TestAgentAssets_ImplementerAllowlists`) covering the new enforcement
  constraints.

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- Shell tokenizer (`mneme hook tokenize`) using `mvdan.cc/sh/v3/syntax` for
  robust `PreToolUse` hook parsing. Handles pipelines, compound commands,
  heredocs, and `bash -c` recursion (SPEC-033).

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- `enforce_delegation.sh` embedded in the mneme binary and installed via
  `mneme install claude-code`. SHA-256 checksum verification with automatic
  backup on update (SPEC-032).
